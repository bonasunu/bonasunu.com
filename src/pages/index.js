              A Little About Me
            </h3>
            <p className="mt-2 mb-3">
              I started to learn full stack development tutorials early in 2020.
              Then I decided to switch my career to become software developer
              and I've been documenting everything I learn ever since. I believe
              many of the routes we take in life should be on dirt paths into
              the unknown. In my life, I have explored several different paths
              all leading in different ventures, but the path that Iâ€™ve enjoyed
              and found the most fulfilling has been in technology and software
              engineering. When I'm not coding, I also watching NBA games,
              hanging out with my friends, read Kindle books, or recook
              Masterchef recipe.
